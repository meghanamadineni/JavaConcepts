/*
* Java defines bitwise operators to function on short, byte, int, long and char
* They act on individual bits of their operands
* Also called the bitwise complement, the unary NOT operator, ~, inverts all of the bits of its
operand.
* and & or | xor ^ have the same meaning.
* The left shift operator, <<, shifts all of the bits in a value to the left a specified number of times.
It has this general form:
value << num
For each shift left, the high-order bit is shifted out (and lost), and a zero is brought
in on the right.
* right shift >> is opposite to left shift. sign extension happens i.e for negative nos. left
most bits are filled with 1 to preserve the sign.
* unsigned right shift >>> fills with zeros.
* bitwise operators also support compount assignments.. |= &= etc.
